### Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

* ðŸ’¼ I'm a Senior Software Engineering Manager at PayIt
* ðŸ”­ When I get hands-on, which isn't all that often these days, it's probably writing MongoDB queries, shell scripts, or tuning kubernetes deployments
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to manage multiple teams. Also Terraform and the GitHub CLI
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: getting into software engineering without a computer science degree
* ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter is good: [@menzenski](https://twitter.com/menzenski), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/menzenski/)
* ðŸ˜„ My pronouns: he/him
* âš¡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in Russian. Or was a few years ago, anyway. I was doing a PhD in Slavic Linguistics before dropping out to pursue software engineering
