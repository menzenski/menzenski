## Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

* ðŸ’¼ I'm a Senior Software Engineering Manager at PayIt, I lead our Data Engineering and Platform Engineering teams.
* ðŸŒ± These days, I'm mostly working with data pipelines: [Meltano](https://meltano.com/) to extract and load, [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) to transform, [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/) (with [Hera](https://hera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to orchestrate.
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: getting into software engineering without a computer science degree
* ðŸ“« How to reach me: Mastodon is best: [@matt@me.nzen.ski](https://me.nzen.ski/@matt), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/menzenski/)
* ðŸ˜„ My pronouns: he/him
* âš¡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in Russian. Or was a few years ago, anyway. I was doing a PhD in Slavic Linguistics before dropping out to pursue software engineering.
