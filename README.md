### Hi, I'm Matt 👋

* 💼 I'm a Senior Software Engineering Manager at PayIt
* 🔭 When I get hands-on, which isn't all that often these days, it's probably writing MongoDB queries, shell scripts, or tuning kubernetes deployments
* 🌱 I’m currently learning how to manage multiple teams. Also Terraform and the GitHub CLI
* 💬 Ask me about: getting into software engineering without a computer science degree
* 📫 How to reach me: Twitter is good: [@menzenski](https://twitter.com/menzenski), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/menzenski/)
* 😄 My pronouns: he/him
* ⚡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in Russian. Or was a few years ago, anyway. I was doing a PhD in Slavic Linguistics before dropping out to pursue software engineering
