## Hi, I'm Matt ğŸ‘‹

* ğŸ’¼ I'm a Senior Software Engineering Manager at PayIt, on our Data Engineering team.
* ğŸ”­ When I get hands-on, I'm most likely writing Terraform modules, writing MongoDB aggregations, or tuning Kubernetes deployments.
* ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Liquibase (database CI/CD), and improving my knowledge of AWS Glue.
* ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: getting into software engineering without a computer science degree
* ğŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter is good: [@menzenski](https://twitter.com/menzenski), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/menzenski/)
* ğŸ˜„ My pronouns: he/him
* âš¡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in Russian. Or was a few years ago, anyway. I was doing a PhD in Slavic Linguistics before dropping out to pursue software engineering
